The 5.2 service items are largely the same as the 5.1 service items. There are two main differences:
1) the 5.2 Upload item provided uses a Task 4 tree. The item and the tree are provided because the tree will 
   likely not import with the item successfully because your task server will be named something different 
   than ours is. Once you import the service items, set the task server information at the catalog level, 
   then import the tree. You should be good to go.
2) The catalog will now have the task server information defined on it. You will need to update this to
   match your task server information.
